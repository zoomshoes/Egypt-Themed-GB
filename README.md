# Untitled Egyptian-Themed GB Game
<b>Coded in <a href="https://www.gbstudio.dev/" about="_blank">GB Studio 3.1!</a></b><br>
<i>This is the new and current repo! The older one will no longer be updated, and everything will be moved over to this one.</i>
## Story
"You, a regular person from modern times, wake up after an otherwise uneventful night in a mysterious dark tomb. As you come to, you start wandering around this tomb, and find the walls inscribed with what looks to your untrained eye like Egyptian hieroglyphics.
You soon make your way out of the tomb, and find yourself on the peak of a small mountain, overlooking the Pyramids in the Necropolis of Egypt. You recognize them from various school textbooks, although they somehow look less worn than you remember from the pictures…
How did you get here? Why are you here? And more importantly, <i>how do you get back?</i>"<br><br>
The player will learn through the story that they must find Thoth, who is the god of space and time, and get him to agree to send them back to where (and when) they came from. Thoth, however, being the god of the moon, exists in a reality that’s somewhat opposite our own, a reality that’s hostile to regular humans. The player must enlist the help of many individuals, god and human alike, to make it through the alternate reality in which Thoth exists.<br><br>
(This story is a WIP, and is not final in any way.)
## Premise/Description
The game will be a turn-based RPG, with one-on-one battles not unlike the Pokemon franchise. I’ve recently completed a playthrough of Pokemon Silver, and really like how the battles are both simple and complex at the same time. I’m not sure yet how much elemental weaknesses and strengths will play into things, but I’m sure it’s doable if it seems like a good fit.<br><br>
The battle system has been pretty decently overhauled and streamlined recently, and I've also converted the project to make use of the Game Boy Color, so learning palettes will be an adventure. This does, however, give me access to the GBC's more powerful processor (8 MHz, vs ~4 MHz, and almost 3x the VRAM), with its double speed mode. This shouldn't be too much of a factor overall, but it's nice to have some overhead I guess if we get into some crazy VRAM manipulation/tile swapping nonsense down the road.<br><br>
I'll post and keep a live todo list here sometime soon, both for my sanity, and as a public roadmap for the project in general, so stay tuned.<br>
## To Do
- Figure out a name
- Replace some of the borrowed assets with my own
- Figure out the arc of the story in general
- Learn and use hUGEtracker to add music
- Add sound effects
- Build a map, and lay out where things are in general
- Re-implement pause menu, including point & click Egypt map
- Probably a million other things that'll come up as we go
