# Untitled Egyptian-Themed GB Game
### Coded in GB Studio 3.1
#### This is the new and current repo! The older one will no longer be updated, and everything will be moved over to this one.

"You, a regular person from modern times, wake up after an otherwise uneventful night in a mysterious dark tomb. As you come to, you start wandering around this tomb, and find the walls inscribed with what looks to your untrained eye like Egyptian hieroglyphics.
You soon make your way out of the tomb, and find yourself on the peak of a small mountain, overlooking the Pyramids in the Necropolis of Egypt. You recognize them from various school textbooks, although they somehow look less worn than you remember from the pictures…
How did you get here? Why are you here? And more importantly, *how do you get back?*"

The player will learn through the story that they must find Thoth, who is the god of space and time, and get him to agree to send them back to where (and when) they came from. Thoth, however, being the god of the moon, exists in a reality that’s somewhat opposite our own, a reality that’s hostile to regular humans. The player must enlist the help of many individuals, god and human alike, to make it through the alternate reality in which Thoth exists.

The game will be a turn-based RPG, with one-on-one battles not unlike the Pokemon franchise. I’ve recently completed a playthrough of Pokemon Silver, and really like how the battles are both simple and complex at the same time. I’m not sure yet how much elemental weaknesses and strengths will play into things, but I’m sure it’s doable if it seems like a good fit.

I'll post and keep a live todo list here sometime soon, both for my sanity, and as a public roadmap for the project in general.
